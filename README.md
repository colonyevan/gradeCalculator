# Grade Calculator

## By Evan Colony <evancolo@umich.edu>

### Purpouse

This is a calculator to help students figure out where they stand in their classes. It can be used on any type of class, however, final grade calculations are bound to be inaccurate due to the way in which some classes calculate final grades.

### Usage

TBD

### Structure

Information about each assignemnt will be kept in a class. The Course class will then contain all the assignments in that course. It will also hold information about dropping assignemnts or other overarching information (WIP). The Course class will also hold a grading class that will be the driver for information about grades, standings, etc. This will have a save/load function that will save all the information in a .csv file becasue classes will not change over the course of their life. Each Course will get its own .csv for simplicity.

### Where I Left Off

Currently working on the strucutre for the assignment class.
