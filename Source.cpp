 * Purpose: This program was written to estimate the final grade needed, as well as predict the final grade you will recieve,
 *          given a specefic test score. Some of these functions rely heavily on applied statistics and theoretical distributions.
 *          This program is NOT the gospel, it is simply an indicator.
 * Dependencies: utility.h, utiltiy.cpp
